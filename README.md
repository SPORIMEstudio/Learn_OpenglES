# Learn_OpenglES

🎮 **Learn_OpenglES** is a personal practice repository for experimenting with OpenGL ES on Android.  
This project helps me learn and test different graphics programming techniques like shaders, rendering pipelines, and custom 2D/3D shapes.

## 📌 Purpose

- Explore OpenGL ES basics (shaders, buffers, textures)
- Practice building simple rendering engines on mobile
- Experiment with lighting, shadows, and custom materials

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (Android)
- OpenGL ES 2.0
- Android IDE
